# Windows 10/11 Software Script
~Before running the script, update Windows apps through the MS Store.~ 
- Installs winget if not already installed
- Set's timezone to Mountain Standard Time
- Grabs Serial Number

### Removes 
- McAfee Products

### Installs
- Google Chrome
- Adobe Reader
- Citrix Workspace
- O365 App
- Office Suite
- Upgrades all installed packages

# How to use
- Make sure the files are all saved in the same directory. Then run `Start.bat` (You don't need to run as admin)
- If the script is having issues running, update all apps through the MS Store

### TODO
- Create installer loop so I can just pass a list
- Do the same thing but just to get rid of McAfee products
- See if there's a way to pull bitlocker keys w/o activating it
